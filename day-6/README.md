# 📦 Project Deployment Overview

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how the project was deployed to **Vercel**, including troubleshooting steps and final results. This will help team members and clients understand the process.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1️⃣ **Project Setup Locally**
1. Ensure the project runs properly in the local environment:
   ```sh
   npm install  # Install dependencies
   npm run dev  # Start the development server
   ```

2. Verify that all pages, routes, and API endpoints work correctly.

---

### 2️⃣ **Configure Environment Variables**
1. **Create an `.env.local` file** in the root directory.
2. Add all required environment variables:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://yourapi.com
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```
3. Ensure that all environment variables required by the project are also **added to Vercel**:
   - Go to **Vercel Dashboard** → **Project Settings** → **Environment Variables**
   - Manually add each variable and click **Save**

---

### 3️⃣ **Deploying to Vercel**
1. Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. Login to Vercel:
   ```sh
   vercel login
   ```
3. Deploy the project:
   ```sh
   vercel --prod
   ```
4. Alternatively, use **Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Connect the project repository
   - Click on **Deploy**

---

### 4️⃣ **Troubleshooting 404 Errors on Vercel**
- **Check Deployment Logs:**
  - Go to **Vercel Dashboard** → **Deployments** → Click on the latest deployment.
  - Look for errors related to missing files, routes, or failed builds.
- **Verify File Structure:**
  - Ensure the `pages/` or `app/` directory is correctly structured.
  - Case sensitivity matters (e.g., `Index.tsx` vs. `index.tsx`).
- **Clear Build Cache & Redeploy:**
  ```sh
  rm -rf .next
  next build
  vercel --prod
  ```

### 📌 Notes:
- If updates are needed, push changes to the repository, and Vercel will auto-deploy.
- Environment variables should be kept secure and updated in both `.env.local` and Vercel settings.
